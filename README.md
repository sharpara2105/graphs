This is about creating a graph given the nodes and edges in a data structure
//yet to be documented.

1. how i changed my datastructure and why that data structure?
2. problems i faced while retrieving through object data structure and later reseacrhed that there is a better alternative that they have created a buuilt in type which can be better used for these kind of situations and we can also dynamically hence assign our values. : "Map"
3. compare and contrast and see its functions which sorts of gives understanding why .incldes method over array was returning false : it was probably because my array was not initialized in a correct way.
hence, it is really very important how we are initializing and utilizing our data structure.
4. one more alternative to the temp array that i was using for array is 
"queue"
 which makes sense if i need ordered vertices and that's my intention of work the whole time.

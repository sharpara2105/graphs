1. Agenda : Create a spanning tree.
Grpah Type : undirected 
using objects instead of map.

This is about creating a graph given the nodes and edges in a data structure and there is no duplication of edges between the nodes and hence there is a single path to every node. Hence, creating a 'Spanning Tree'.


(i) how i changed my datastructure and why that data structure?
(ii) problems i faced while retrieving through object data structure and later reseacrhed that there is a better alternative that they have created a buuilt in type which can be better used for these kind of situations and we can also dynamically hence assign our values. : "Map"
(iii) compare and contrast and see its functions which sorts of gives understanding why .incldes method over array was returning false : it was probably because my array was not initialized in a correct way.
hence, it is really very important how we are initializing and utilizing our data structure.
(iv) one more alternative to the temp array that i was using for array is 
"queue"
 which makes sense if i need ordered vertices and that's my intention of work the whole time.

 2. Agenda : create a minimum spaning tree.
 Grpah Type : undirected 
 Data Structure : Array of objects
